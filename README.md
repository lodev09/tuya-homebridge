## Bridge to HomeKit

Open the Home app on your Apple device. Pair with Homebridge by scanning the QR code printed in the step of starting the plugin, or entering the 8-digit PIN code. You can find the PIN code in the `config.json` file.

## Contribution guide

Fork Tuya's Homebridge repo in GitHub and follow the step-by-step tutorial to start the plugin service.

### Set up the development environment

```
—-VSCode
—-engines
    "node": “>=0.12.0”
    "homebridge": ">=0.2.0"
—-dependencies
    "axios": “^0.21.1",
    "crypto-js": “^4.0.0”, 
    "mqtt": “^4.2.6",
    "uuid": "^8.3.2"
```

### Support more accessory types

#### How to implement plugins

#### Pay attention to several JSON files

* The entry file `index.js`. Add your desired accessory type to the `addAccessory()` function and create the `xx_accessy.js` file.

<img src="https://images.tuyacn.com/app/Hanh/index.js.png" alt="JSON file" style="zoom:130%;" />

* The `xx_accessory.js` file. In this file, traverse your newly created function in `refreshAccessoryServiceIfNeed()` and get the `Characteristic` corresponding to a service.

<img src="https://images.tuyacn.com/app/Hanh/xx_accessory.js.png" alt="JSON file" style="zoom:130%;" />

* The `tuyaopenapi.js` file contains device related APIs.
* The `tuyamqttapi.js` file supports the MQTT service.

## What is HomeKit?

HomeKit is Apple's smart home platform introduced in 2014. It allows users of Apple devices to securely and easily control any devices with a 'Works with Apple HomeKit' badge, such as lights, door locks, thermostats, outlets, and many more.

## What is Homebridge?

Homebridge is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. It supports plugins that provide a basic bridge from HomeKit to various third-party APIs provided by manufacturers of smart home devices. We recommend you check the [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/blob/master/README.md) before getting started with Homebridge plugins.

## Users

If you are a smart home geek and have a bundle of devices from different platforms, this step-by-step tutorial will help you make devices HomeKit-enabled and then develop Tuya Homebridge plugins.
